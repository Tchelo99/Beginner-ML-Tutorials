# TensorFlow Beginner Tutorial
Welcome to the TensorFlow Beginner Tutorial! This guide will walk you through the basics of TensorFlow and how to use it for building and training machine learning models. You'll learn how to implement key deep learning concepts such as neural networks, optimizers, and how to run an end-to-end example on a real-world dataset.

## Contents
### Introduction to TensorFlow

What is TensorFlow?
Why use TensorFlow?
### Getting Started with TensorFlow

* Installation
* Tensor Basics: Tensors, Operations, and Graphs
* Building a Simple Neural Network with the Sequential API
### Neural Network Components

* Layers, Activation Functions, and Loss Functions
* Optimizers and Backpropagation
### Custom Training Loops

* Understanding Eager Execution
* Building a Training Loop from Scratch
### End-to-End Example

* Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset
* Evaluating and Visualizing Results

## Installation
To get started, you'll need to install TensorFlow. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## How to Run the Tutorial
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tchelo99/Beginner-ML-Tutorials.git
```
Navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd TensorFlow
```
Open the notebook in Jupyter or any preferred environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook tensorflow_tutorial.ipynb
```

## Dataset
The end-to-end example uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags). This tutorial guides you through data loading, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Numpy
* Matplotlib


## Conclusion
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation in TensorFlow and the confidence to explore deeper into advanced topics like RNNs, LSTMs, or more complex architectures.
