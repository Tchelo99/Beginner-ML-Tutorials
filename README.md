## **Getting Started**

To get started with these tutorials, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your machine along with some common machine learning libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. Each tutorial folder contains the necessary information and code examples you can follow along with.

Before you begin, it's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv ml_tutorials_env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
ml_tutorials_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source ml_tutorials_env/bin/activate

# Install common dependencies
pip install torch tensorflow scikit-learn
```
