## Installation
To get started, you'll need to install PyTorch. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## How to Run the Tutorial
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tchelo99/Beginner-ML-Tutorials.git
```
Navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd PyTorch
```
Open the notebook in Jupyter or any preferred environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook pytorch_tutorial.ipynb
```

## Dataset
The tutorial uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats. This example will show you how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on these images to classify them into the correct categories.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* Torchvision
* Numpy
* Matplotlib


## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you'll gain a strong understanding of the PyTorch framework, allowing you to confidently build and experiment with your own deep learning models. Dive deeper into PyTorch and explore more advanced topics like RNNs, GANs, and reinforcement learning!
